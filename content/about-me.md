title: About me
---

I'm a software engineer and data scientist with a background in machine learning and natural language processing research. I've worked on web development and data engineering over the past couple of years at Epic Systems outside of Madison, WI. I'm excited about learning new technologies (right now I'm designing a mobile version of my team's application) and always interested in improving my design and architecture skills (recently I spent the day at a usability design conference). Feel free to reach out at jlklafka [at] gmail [dot] com.

In my free time, I run, hike, cook and watch horror movies.

Okay so what matters here
 - fullstack
 - research
 - data science
 - NLP
 - curious
 - new technology
