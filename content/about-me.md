title: About me
---

I'm a software engineer and data scientist with a background in machine learning and natural language processing research. I've worked on web development and data engineering over the past few years at Alexa and Epic Systems. I'm excited about learning new technologies, and I'm always interested in improving my design and system architecture skills. Feel free to reach out at jlklafka [at] gmail [dot] com.

In my free time, I run, hike, cook and watch horror movies.
