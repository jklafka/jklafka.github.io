title: About me
---

I'm a software engineer and data scientist with a background in natural language processing and cognitive science research. I've worked on web development and data engineering over the past few years at Alexa and Epic Systems. I'm excited about learning new technologies, and I'm always interested in improving my design and system architecture skills. Feel free to reach out at jlklafka [at] gmail [dot] com.

In my free time, I run, hike, cook and watch horror movies.

Here's a recent picture of me at [the Gum Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gum_Wall) in downtown Seattle:
