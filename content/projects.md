## Research

In a past life, I was a computer and cognitive scientist. I published work for two main projects, both of which are available as free full-text PDFs online with all code and data available on GitHub (I'm an advocate of open and reproducible science).

### Spying on your neighbors: Fine-grained probing of contextual embeddings for information about surrounding words

Working with Allyson Ettinger of the Toyota Technological Institute of Chicago. We investigated what linguistic information contextual word embedding vectors of words in English contained about surrounding words. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01810) [GitHub](https://github.com/jklafka/context-probes)

### Characterizing the Typical Information Curves of Diverse Languages

Working with Dan Yurovsky of Carnegie Mellon University. We investigated how the high-level properties of a language can influence (if not determine or limit) how speakers of that language structure what they say.
